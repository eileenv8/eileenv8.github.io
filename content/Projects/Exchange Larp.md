There's been a bug in the system that's destroyed much of the banking system that we use today. Rumors are circulating as to the cause - was it a cyberattack? a 6th dimensional being? a bug in an ancient legacy system? We don't know. 

A lot of infrastructure is still in place, but now access to dollars is scarce, and credit card use is impossible. You can take out cash at periodic checkpoints, but it's now important to prioritize other forms of exchange. 

There's talk of cloud systems being the next to go. Blockchains are usable because they are distributed, but many people don't regard these forms of exchange as legitimately valuable. 

Your challenge is to get ahead of the impending doom as an exchange researcher and explorer, creating new markets through radical proposals. It may be challenging, but you also may find you need to create relationships -- relationships that give you and others more than you thought you wanted!
