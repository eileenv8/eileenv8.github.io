This #personal-essay is mostly baked and pretty rambly. I simply haven't finished the end. But I did spend quite a bit of time trying. It was written in the summer of 2023. 

# Tides of History
History moves as a tide. We little specks ride its waves, and sometimes there is a great person or idea or event that crests a wave. We name them hero or villain, we attribute the change to them. Thank you; fuck you. 

That's what I got out of the dual release of Barbie and Oppenheimer. Both films are titled after their protagonist, the figurehead of some bigger movement of the tides of history. 

The release of both highly anticipated movies had become, for some, an omen. The dual release occurred on a significant astrological event: the Venus Cazimi of its current retrograde cycle. A Cazimi is when a planet passes through the heart of the sun, symbolizes the unification of its archetype with that of the sun, which is life-force, the ego, personality. In this case the feminine planet of desire, money, and love met the central force of our solar system during the pivotal moment in its cycle of review just as two movies about American tsunamis of cultural impact were released. 

A synchronistic commentary about the last century of American culture, the meaning of which is to be deciphered by us. A delightful mystic-intellectual mystery. I answered the call with popcorn and journal in hand. 

I enjoyed both movies but I cried much more during Barbie. 

## American Anthropocene: Plutonium and Plastic
In an article for the Washington Post, Tyler Austin Harper, a professor of environmental studies, writes an epic interpretation of Barbenheimer, *The Age of Nukes and Plastic*, from his earth-based perspective. He writes that Barbie and Oppenheimer are both markers of the Anthropocene, a newly proposed geological era on the Earth's historical record that is marked by man-made compounds sinking irrevocably into the ecosystems of our planet. 

“It’s a reality in a world where humanity has baked its worst vices into the Earth’s geological record. Despite their apparent differences, both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” tell the story of core ideas of the 20th century: accelerating militarism and unbounded consumption, ideas that might well outlive our species in the form of plastic and plutonium’s lingering traces across our fragile planet.”

DuPont is the company which produced both Plutonium and Plastic starting in the mid-1940’s. DuPont doesn't make a great character though; perhaps it could make a villain if written right, but DuPont is more emblematic of a sinister pollution of the material of our compost pile, a foul life-killing ammonia. DuPont is the peak of an Western meme: that it's good to push beyond the limits of nature, that we are not a part of nature but instead its masters. Reality bends to our will, we create strange new mutant molecules. They serve our purposes, energy and destruction and all the cheap plastic forms imaginable. But each is a pandora's box of unexpected consequences. 

In Harper's essay, he evokes the image of these chemicals seeping deep into the earth, contaminating it. They are here to stay now, these strange bastard molecules of DuPont. They are in the ecosystem for generations unending, here now to outlast humanity itself. These toxic compounds were produced by humans as byproducts of two of the most destructive sins of our era, consumerism and nuclear war.

## Barbie, the Women's Wavebreak, and Imperfection

Barbie was revolutionary only in the fact of its ordinariness. It didn't make any revolutionary Feminist claims. It's solidly situated in a feminism which is undoubtedly mainstream, with wide appeal, and its seemingly controversial claims aren't really controversial but are rather uncreatively anti-establishment, which at this point is mainstream anyways. 

It doesn't matter. Barbie's impact isn't about its hard-hitting feminist theory thesis. I saw Barbie the same weekend that Taylor Swift played two shows in my hometown, Seattle. That weekend, the streets were flooded with sequin-covered mothers and daughters of many ages. 

For this epic long weekend women flooded public spaces to consume media that was by them, for them. It was amazing. It was beautiful. I wished I'd been there to see Taylor and Haim (a band of sisters) performing an epic show at a stop on the most profitable tour of all time. 

It's awe-some. The wave of history that is women's independence has crashed with a shimmer and sizzle on the shore. I experienced it not as the exhilaration of the crest of the wave but the silent and satisfying conclusion of it. Women can make media for themselves, consume media made for them, make the money to buy the tickets and the outfits and pay for it from their own bank accounts. 

[a pink wave has crashed on the shore]

It is shiny and sparkly and beautiful and pink. It is not bringing us closer together. At the entrance to my woman's event of the weekend, the Barbie film, I looked at a woman standing alone dressed to the nines; a stylish lonely Barbie. I wanted to connect with her but the only thing I could think of was to compliment her outfit. So I said nothing. 

We are free (mostly, here). But we are using that freedom to gather around the stage and the screen. We are not using that freedom to gather in circles. (Me, most of us). 

## Pregnant Barbie

I saw Barbie with three other women, all of us dressed in pink. I posed in the big pink box at the entrance to the theater, holding my growing belly: I was Pregnant Barbie! We all laughed. (I wore a fine pink wool sweater I found in my mom's closet, virtually unworn. Later I dreamed it was unraveling at the collar; I liked it better that way.)

During the movie when the real pregnant Barbie, Midge, was introduced, the women around me smiled and pointed at me. Ha! It's you! 

In the film the quickly discontinued Midge is a punchline. *Who wants a pregnant barbie?* The film keeps her hidden away for comedic effect, with a mild disgust. Just like how it's described that the Barbies treat Weird Barbie, the chopped-up fritzed out hermitess played by Kate McKinnon who acts as the film's Crone: Stereotypical Barbie's world-wizened guide.

Pregnant Midge appears a few times for a smile and a wave, but never more than for a few seconds. Only because she existed, and then wasn't wanted to exist anymore. *Who wants a pregnant Barbie?* 

The film doesn't really know what to do with Mothers. And yet, Gloria (who I'd argue is the film's main character) is a mother, and the triangle of relationship between her, her teenage daughter, and Robbie's Barbie as a projection of Gloria's imagination is the driving force of the film. And ultimately, the un-real Barbie chooses to become human, spurred by images of Real life that barely touch the rawness of Womanhood. Ordinary Barbie can be a mother - or not.

Ideas live forever; humans only live once. A piece of concluding wisdom from Barbie’s Wise woman to Margot Robbie Stereotypical Barbie. 

For me, the film is about the interplay of the imaginal realms with our physical world - and, consequently, the protagonist is not Stereotypical Barbie but Gloria, played by America Ferreira. 

As she nears the end of her journey she wears a simple modest sundress with notably imperfect seaming and, on her face, a soft and open expression. The empty doll-grin she wore in previous scenes has broken as she's been bashed by existential crises after entering the Real World; after completing the trials and tribulations of saving Barbieland from the memetic virus of patriarchy. 

The imperfect dress is no accident: the costuming in this movie is impeccable. The choice of a sundress one could buy at a department store for $50 (or less if it were on sale) shows that Robbie is now Ordinary Barbie: just in time for Gloria, the Real Girl Grown Up who's imaginations become Robbie's reality, to pitch Ordinary Barbie to Mattel's CEO. 

In Harper’s piece, the refrain ideas live forever is linked to the seemingly permanent intrusion of these very-human chemicals into the systems of the Earth. Plutonium and Plastic are very physical evidence of the immortality of human ideas.

But ideas matter

Merry Dunemas

I sat before an IMAX screen, distracted from the previews before Oppenheimer. On a mission to say something meaningful about the dual release of Barbie and Oppenheimer (Barbenheimer), I had my notebook at the ready. But what struck me first was actually the preview for the re-do of an older epic - the second installation of Dune. 

Sitting next to my father, we look at each other in excitement: watching the first Dune most years is one of the few sacred traditions we share. It'll be released in November - "just in time for Christmas!" He laughs. 

I beam and also paraphrase some of the preview in my journal:

*It's a story it's a prophecy... what's the difference?*

Dune is an epic about the creation of a prince who was prophesied, on purpose but maybe in a destined way. An ambiguously manufactured messiah, if you will. 

Some years for a while now, around or on Christmas, we'll watch the old Dune - a campy nonsensical-sensical sci-fi pre-cgi wonder of a movie that probably won't make sense unless you've read the book - and we'll make fun of it but also genuinely enjoy it while we play with our new things. 

This tradition is a beautiful fruiting vine growing from the cultural compost pile of this bubble of my family. Really, it's just three of us - my sister, father and I. Perhaps my step-mother and Jewish step-siblings will soon join. 

Somehow in this small family, with a patriarch as secular as can be, we watch on Christmas a story about the messiah, which I'd actually never put together until I wrote this sentence. It's just that, for us, it's not about the birth of Jesus or the pagan rituals of midwinter or anything else I'd pretend to understand: it's just the youthful Kyle McLaughlin playing prince Paul Atreides, leading the people of the desert planet Arrakis to revolution. (Using giant worms and psychedelic spice powers, of course). 

In the house of the matriarch, my mother, we watch Hallmark. 

There's something to say about my family's trees on Christmas too: my father's techno-utopic tree is a huge plastic fuzzy green thing covered in blinding rainbow LEDs - programmable, of course. And my mother's tree changes, but it's always a real evergreen - either one of the last ones at home depot that nobody wanted, or a scraggly young tree that was going to be cut down for firewood anyways. 

[charlie brown tree]

I prefer the "charlie brown" tree - I'm partial to the story that pagans brought a tree inside to invite the nature spirits in during the dark of winter. But the plastic monstrosity is impressively beautiful, and I'm finally admitting that it has a spirit as well. We're just not as close.

I love Christmas (or used to, before my parents divorced and it became unavoidably painful). In my family it has never been explicitly a celebration of the sacred, as it's 'supposed' to be. It's usually very focused on the things, like most good American 'Christians'. But it was wonderful and magical not because of the things (although that helped the wow value), but because it was a time we would simply Be together.

When I turned 18 and left home, my family collapsed at the same moment I stepped across the threshold. My parents divorced; the home I'd had was gone, fractured. I did not have one place to belong anymore, I had two or three. 

I stepped into a new ecosystem where I hoped to find home, one steeped in a resonant tradition, pungent and fragrant with its unique culture. "The most liberal college in the US," Reed. Attracted by its lofty philosophy and establishment-bucking narratives of roguish grungy intellectualism, I was ready and excited to engage deeply with its foundational course Hum110, a space for critical engagement with the Western classics.

I learned this in college as I labored to preserve some goofy traditions just as they had been the previous year, taking great effort and limiting my creativity in a certain way. Later, in a delve deep into the archives of my college, I discovered the original form of the tradition, in the undiluted form of its original creation. It had the flavor a labor of love. My version was distorted -- still fun, but distorted by the strange guardrails that had developed over the years. 

I had taken at face value the guardrails I had been given; I did it the way it was done the year before. I was limited by the information that was easy to get; I limited myself based on what I was told, in service to some imagined false god of preservation. 

The reality was, the structure I so meticulously followed wasn't the part of the tradition people loved. The structure I followed made it longer and drearier, more inaccessible, and more difficult to produce.
