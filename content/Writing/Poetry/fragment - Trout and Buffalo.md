Trout: almost anywhere they exist they are not native.

Trout evolved to become distinct to each stream, evolved to become emblematic of the spirit of the river. 

Together we can seed a new indigeneity, to be lived by our descendants. 

What does it mean to be intact with what emerges from the ecosystem?

What does this intactness look like now?

The buffalo comes to me in a dream
somehow softer than velvet
she is curious and powerful. 
alongside her is a boy calf.

we can hunt them only one day a year, I am told.
I gaze into her eyes and she back into mine
I touch her curly fur with both of my hands
In awe we share a poignant moment.

then she continues her explorations through the stands.
the crowd around me
Is here to gather in celebration of knowledge
each is a speaker, with our own discoveries. 

As the buffalo wanders the crowd, 
only a few notice
only a few touch.
I touch with both hands, 
I touch more than once

Three of us agree, 
It is the day we will hunt the buffalo
another woman who will speak about birth too
and a man who I don't know

The buffalo leaves the crowd for an adjacent field
and I slip away to follow.
I want her pelt.
I want the honor of her life, her legacy.

The man and I reach the field
somehow, we turn on each other
and instead of hunting the buffalo we are tussling 
wrestling in the long grass

He is stronger than me
But I have some tricks up my sleeve
And I bend his arm backwards to subdue him.

After our struggle I look up
to golden waves of grain
