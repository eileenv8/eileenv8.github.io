Devon said, today, at the tour:
"sorry, I don't want to be a mom about this"
when describing her need to hurry us in and out of the cars

I was struck
Oh, that's what being a mom is, isn't it? That's the JOB. 
In a car-based city. 
That slip of the tongue, so revealing (did she get nervous for my response, after?)

She, who is dedicating her life to building a new city free of fast cars
presumably for her kids
does that slip of the tongue belie her pain there?
*a car drove into my bedroom wall when I was a teenager*
Oh, yes, what an impact. 

That's the job. Chauffeur. Timekeeper. School guard. 
My dental hygenist tells me, *oh just you wait* 
when I say I will never be a chauffeur. 
*he's going to want to play sports.*
I shudder but realize she's right, 
if we live in a city like this one where I'm getting my fillings done, he will want to play soccer, and I will be the one to drive him twenty minutes both ways to practice and get him in and out of the car and pack every lunch and

Motherhood -- the [evolved nest](https://evolvednest.org/) style of childrearing -- 
'Mom' -hood -- the standard USA version of SAHM childrearing. 

See - Free Range Kids movement, Lenore Skenazy
## Overview with Claude

**“Motherhood” (Evolutionary/Biological)**

- Preparing children for independence and survival
- Teaching risk assessment and resilience through allowance of risk-taking
- Modeling adult competence and community engagement
- Gradual release of control as children mature
- Success measured by child’s eventual self-sufficiency

**“Mom-ing” (Modern Cultural Construct)**

- Managing every aspect of child’s experience
- Eliminating all risks and discomforts
- Constant supervision and intervention
- Maintaining control to demonstrate “good parenting”
- Success measured by how much you sacrifice/how busy you are

**Car Culture Analysis**:

- Motherhood would trust kids to walk/bike places → Mom-ing drives them everywhere
- Motherhood teaches navigation skills → Mom-ing provides GPS and pickup service

**Free-Range Movement**:

- Motherhood says “figure it out” → Mom-ing says “let me handle that”
- Motherhood accepts scraped knees as learning → Mom-ing bubble-wraps everything

**Nomadic Families**:

- Motherhood embraces uncertainty as growth → Mom-ing needs controlled environments
- Motherhood trusts children’s adaptability → Mom-ing worries about “stability”

**Child Development Outcomes**:

- Children of “mothers” learn self-reliance → Children of “moms” learn helplessness
- Motherhood creates future adults → Mom-ing creates extended children

This framing also reveals how “**intensive mothering” culture actually undermines the biological imperative to raise independent humans.** You’re not anti-mother - you’re pro-motherhood in its truest sense!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
