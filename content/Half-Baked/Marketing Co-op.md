## The idea:
A digital-first marketing co-op consisting of a network of contractors who band together for equity in their own firm. Remote, but has quarterly in-person meetups to foster relationships for higher levels of trust and collaboration. Serves startups and small companies who aren't scaled enough to need to hire a full-time marketing person. Employs AI tooling for higher productivity and more leverage with time. 
### Background
My favorite work I've ever done-- the work that was the most stimulating, fulfilling, and felt the most helpful to others-- was a project where I worked on deep market research and proposed a strategy to an emerging AI company. I also managed their social media. 

Now that I'm a mother, I'm looking for new ways of working where I can still assist others with my intelligence and creativity while maintaining a flexible schedule. And as I'm still early in my career I'd like to have some mentorship. This looks to me like working with someone with more experience, helping with their projects, and getting honest feedback from them. I want to do this in a high-commitment sort of way, which is why a co-op model, which because of its worker-owner model can decrease flake rates. 


## Supporting research

### [Here's a research report from Claude on other digital-first coops.](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/016e9763-d41a-4926-8af9-4c3205980f46)
Some of the information is outdated, and the most interesting ones to me are outside of my country (The federated CoTech UK co-op )

[Loomio] is a great case study and resource. They have a [page with information on cooperatives!](https://www.loomio.com/blog/tags/cooperatives)
