Reading [A Room of one's Own](A%20Room%20of%20one's%20Own.md) by [Virginia Woolf](Virginia%20Woolf.md)
### our bodies are not separate from our surroundings. 

"one cannot think well, sleep well, if one has not dined well" (18, Woolf, ARO)

Just as the spider's web is an extension of its body, (like [Sophie Strand](Sophie%20Strand.md) cites in a recent video), our domiciles and our meals and our gardens are a part of our bodies. 

This is also why a mother's job is important. If she is making meals with love, her children are doing better, embody that love. It is not some woo woo bullshit. It is a fact of being a living creature. 

## women are the ones who bear the children
this is just throbbing in my head

in this age it's controversial, with the trans- movement having already proliferated so broadly, into the minds of the educated and into our infrastructure

but it's not a controversial statement

but what about infertility? an infertile woman is still a woman! 
yes, because her experience is now marked by an impossible potential -- her body might have born a child, were something not awry. She is still of the body of the large gamete. 

women are the ones who bear the children. That's why we are the poorer sex. Because we were busy making people. Busy making everyone who ever lived, including you. And unfortunately that doesn't pay well. 

It's a flaw right at the heart of the money paradigm. 

> Is it better to be a coal-heaver or a nursemaid; is the charwoman who has brought up eight children of less value to the world than the barrister who has made a hundred thousand pounds? It is useless to ask such questions; for nobody can answer them. Not only do the comparative values of charwomen and lawyers rise and fall from decade to decade, but we have no rods with which to measure them even as they are at the moment. I had been foolish to ask my professor to furnish me with "indisputable proofs" of this or that in his argument about women. Even if one could state the value of any one gift at the moment, those values will change; in a century's time very possibly they will have changed completely. Moreover, in a hundred years, I thought, reaching my own doorstep, women will have ceased to be the protected sex. Logically they will take part in all the activities and exertions that were once denied them. The nursemaid will heave coal. The shop-woman will drive an engine. All assumptions founded on the facts observed when women were once the protected sex will have disappeared--as, for example (here a squad of soldiers marched down the street), that women and clergymen and gardeners live longer than other people. Remove that protection, expose them to the same exertions and activities, make them sailors and soldiers and engine-drivers and dock-laborers, and not will women die off so much younger, so much quicker, than men that one will say, "I saw a woman today," as one used to say, "I saw an aeroplane"

Okay, I thought that that last bit was different. I thought that she had been commenting, people would ask, "what is a woman, even?" but that question was not even possible to think, I think. The real statement she is making here is that women would die far more quickly if forced to do mens work. Mens and womens bodies are different and suited to different work. obviously. If we don't protect women they will die by the scores. 


>For masterpieces are not single and solitary births; they are the outcome of many years of thinking in common, of thinking by the body of the people, so that the experience of the mass is behind the single voice.

### some wikipedia adventures investigating [Athena](Athena.md) 

I was thinking about girl baby names, as I've been doing lately -- yes, I am hoping for a girl child next, although I know it's too soon. 

As a child, I loved Athena, the goddess of wisdom. Today, I wear an owl feather in my hat--one of my most treasured gifts from Nature. 

In my recent wikipedia adventures, I discovered that Athena was likely the city-goddess of Athens, and that there was a wooden statue of her called a Palladium and said to have magical properties. 

> from (wikipedia article on Palladium)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium_(classical_antiquity)] 
> > The Trojan Palladium was said to be a wooden image of [Pallas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallas_\(daughter_of_Triton\) "Pallas (daughter of Triton)") (whom the [Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") [identified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretatio_graeca "Interpretatio graeca") with [Athena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena "Athena") and the [Romans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome") with Minerva) and to have fallen from heaven in answer to the prayer of [Ilus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilus "Ilus"), the founder of [Troy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy "Troy").


Reminds me of [Asherah](Asherah.md) and what I learned about "an Asherah" being also the wooden statues guarding temples representing the goddess. 

Looks like palladiums, as well, were found objects and not necessarily man-made carvings.

> The goddess Athena was worshipped on the [Acropolis of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_of_Athens "Acropolis of Athens") under many names and cults, the most illustrious of which was of the _Athena Poliás_, "[protectress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutelary_deity "Tutelary deity") of the city". The cult image of the _Poliás_ was a wooden effigy, often referred to as the "_xóanon diipetés_" (the "carving that fell from heaven"), made of olive wood and housed in the east-facing wing of the [Erechtheum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erechtheum "Erechtheum") temple in the classical era. Considered not a man-made artefact but of divine provenance, it was the holiest image of the goddess and was accorded the highest respect. It was placed under a bronze likeness of a palm tree and a gold lamp burned in front of it.

> The centerpiece of the grand feast of the [Panathenaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panathenaea "Panathenaea") was the replacement of this statue's woolen [peplos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peplos "Peplos") (a garment) with a newly woven one. It was also carried to the sea by the priestesses and ceremonially washed once a year, in the feast called the _[Plynteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plynteria "Plynteria")_ ("washings"). Its presence was last mentioned by the [Church Father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Father "Church Father") [Tertullian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertullian "Tertullian") who described it derisively as nothing but "a rough stake, a shapeless piece of wood".[19](19.md)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium_\(classical_antiquity\)#cite_note-19) Earlier descriptions of the statue have not survived.
