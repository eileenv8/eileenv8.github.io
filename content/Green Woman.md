## modern mother yearns for, contemplates, becomes - wild.

"Life doesn't come with a manual... it comes with a mother" 
	- A Mother's Day sign outside a small business
### out of office in the place beyond time

It has been months... No! it has been a year! Already? And it has not been longer?

I am changing as fast as the baby grows, it seems. Do you know how fast a baby grows? Neither of us last longer than a day.

Skin sloughs off my back, transformation driving me into darkness. I feel my new skin.  It's not red and wet, it's soft as moss. Yielding yet firm as if growing upon a hundred-year-old tree. 

In germanic myths, the [moss women](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/134c3af8-52bc-4e9d-aaab-c753e181cea3) are fae who may live a decade in our one day. They emerge from the forest to guide a favored traveler to safety, or trick an evil one to their doom. 

With the baby I've lived an eternity and no time at all. Perhaps it is the world of the woods wives I have touched to bring back new life. 

When I crawl out of the postpartum swamp onto the sticky shores of motherhood, I am *bigger,* and not just in body. I am softer but also harsher. Protective. I am something deep and ancient. My knowledge is the alchemy that women know: of leavened bread and a kitchen turned cleaner with use.

In the mirror I see the buds of crows feet blossom outwards from my eyes. 

I miss my mind the way it was. I miss my memory. I feel a decade older. 

_Oh god, I've given my wits away! My wits, my precious wits! Did I have them to begin with?_

I am told: "the brain changes are priming you for learning." 

Agape, I stare at a scan of a mother's brain compared to one of a non-mother. It is shrunken and dark. Its capacity for memory is throttled.

And yet, phrases brand themselves into my mind's fleshy grooves. These are made for stories passed from mouth to ear. But my elders are few and I am hungry for wisdom. The truths implanting in my soft and vulnerable heart are not my own. I glean direction from dancing words and images strung about through glowing wires.  I know not what else to do.

As is the caterpillar in the cocoon, I am liquid and trapped. Hyper-plastic, mushy. My instincts have compelled me to make a chrysalis of four dark, thick walls. 

What does a butterfly look like?

I find a therapist and ask her: "how do I know what I want?"

During foggy battles in my early days postpartum, my husband listens to me complain. "I don't want to live". I ask him why he wants to live. He says, "I want to live for you and our son."

I think that is very noble, and I appreciate it. But I don't say it back. I turn it over in my mind, consider it, try to step into it.

Instead I say, "I hate myself. I'm fat. I'm weak. I'm dumb."

I write from these gooey depths and at the end, he proofs it. 

I suppose, in hindsight, that my melancholic navel-gazing was my answer to the great-grandmother's question: "What are you doing for yourself these days?"

In truth being together is soft and warm and delightful. *I want to spend eternity here in your arms, dear.* Now *that's* hard to write about. Plus, how cliche. 

The soft simplicity of being together, content, seems to be the point of it all. 

For a while I forget what work I was trying to do before. Emails and spreadsheets. So many words. I forget anything but the home and the grocer. I forget even to write.

On the left of my mind there is a thought-stream canyon that bubbles with commentary. It spits out witty one-liners and scathing insults. My first drafts are written there.

For a while, (days? weeks?), it dries up. Its riverbed breathes.

[Us-two](https://disruptr.deakin.edu.au/society/indigenous-perspective-lays-out-a-path-to-save-the-planet/), mom-dad, are changing with the baby. We're morphing into a new organism, all three of us. Interdependent.

Within our four-walled lair we rest and wrestle, sleep and wake. Bleed and bite. Get messy, get clean. Messy again. Messy, messy... how did it get so messy again? 

I wake in my bed at dawn as the rooster crows. We yawn and stretch and greet the morning, nuzzling each other. The baby sleeps still in the hollow of my body. The wet air smells like sweat, cookies, and milk breath. My mate stokes the first fires of the morning while I rest. Now he toils, tap tap tap, on the keys. 

Later, jealous, I pace the house. I overwhelm myself with noticing too many undone chores. The baby wants to be on me all the time and I am not used to the burden of this constant energy sink. It stresses me out. 

It's like our cottage is accelerating entropy and I have been cast, unbeknownst, as its only enemy. *How did it get so messy again?* Sometimes, enraged but stuck, the mess is all I can see. The brain changes have skyrocketed my need for cleanliness without a proportional increase in skill. 

Diligently and with angst I keep the home in order (mostly) and the bellies fed (enough). I listen. I hold. I grow grey and weary and hungry for something just on the edge of my consciousness.  I can't reach it, like a dream after waking. Like attempting to recall a forgotten word. 

As I gnaw on this puzzle, my shape shifts. I find I have molded myself into a mother who is soft and warm and carrying sweets. A mother who is fearful of leaving the nest, with the words *no- watch out- be careful* on her lips. 

I make a pearl necklace out of folded dirty diapers. I do it every day.

Did you know that before plastic we made diapers out of moss? That we cleaned with moss? Our ally moss kept us clean and warm. It carried our waste back to the hungry soil. 

I gaze in wonder at the myriad mosses that cover the forest floor. I sniff them and roll a piece between my fingers, slipping it into my pocket. Which kind would I have gathered for my baby if I had lived a thousand years ago?

I can't seem to find the answer on the internet.

The screen. I feel helpless and unequipped to battle the screen. At any free moment, there I am, scrolling the endless stream. 

I try to hide it from him, my little feral cherub. But he's so curious. *Oh well, I myself was raised with the screen. How bad can it be?*

As I struggle to unhook myself from the feed, I wonder if literacy itself is a curse. What are we really doing as we orient towards the sound-glyph?

I'm instructed to read to my -months old baby every day. At the beginning he can't understand what I read to him, and there's no context to help him learn. It's a weird and unnatural thing to do, to present him with dead words on a page, with abstract images of animals from distant lands. *Have I ever seen a Zebra? I guess maybe once, in the zoo, a captive...*

A baby book toy made of crinkly fabric containing the alphabet shows up on our bed. A gift from someone. He likes the crinkly plastic. It always falls open to the middle two letters, N-O.

As I do chores I listen to audiobooks about what it was like to be a human long ago, before there were books. I learn about evolved nests, I learn about indigenous knowledge. 

At a post-church coffee hour, our local pastor Fr. Berto shared a particularly illuminating anecdote on the subject. When living in Puerto Rico, he had a lunch guest who lived rurally. Out of habit the guest simply threw their scraps -- chicken bones, I think -- to the floor. Berto was shocked, but soon realized it was just another way of living. They were used to having animals clean up after them!

In my house, I clean up after my baby, who throws his scraps to the floor as if to feed a wild animal. It's my job to correct him, to civilize him.

Must I expunge the wild? Living in the way we do, yes, I must. Maybe it is always the mother's job to tame her son. 

The feeling of the soles of my feet compacting various sticky or crumbly messes into the fake-wood vinyl floor almost sends me into fits. I keep track of my slippers at all times to protect myself from the horror of the crumbs.

It turns out that cleanliness is relative. It's a real quality, but its parameters are culturally constructed. There are all sorts of models. It depends on the cultural norms in the place where you are. 

Think of what it used to take to wash clothes. Pounding and pounding in the river. No need for a workout after that! But now we have washing machines, and yet the laundry seems a burden still -- the standards are different! 

I remember one day in Macroeconomics my jovial old professor presented us a theory: **it's possible that the models we agree upon create the way the world works.** 

If intelligence is measured and optimized for by the literate, what sorts of intelligence are we missing out on? We mold our brains into the machines which can digest the world in words. There are other forms of intelligence. There are other ways of seeing. Ways of seeing which might bring us closer to reality. Ways of seeing which might help us regenerate a poisoned earth.

I want to live in a world where we *see* moss maidens. Where we leave them offerings and fall for their seduction. Where we throw our scraps to the ravens and our waste is food for the trees. Trees are so generous to us. Yet, we would withhold the food we have for them, the very food from our bodies. 

Think of an iron casket full of a body full of formaldehyde. We would fight even becoming dust. We poison even the body we have no use for anymore. 

Industrial monoculture farming is depleting soil, producing picture-perfect produce devoid of nutrients. Our waste goes down the tube, into a septic or a sewer, for treatment or incineration. Out of sight, out of mind, out of system. Externalized internality. 

I'm reminded of another anecdote, from a friend who had traveled to India. 

"They had the most beautiful produce, so I asked them how they grew it, what kind of fertilizer they used. They pointed to the toilets. "

Today, [nutrients are reclaimed from less than 20% of wastewater,](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/dceacc1e-1610-4cdf-b046-d8d09509ef63) but this industry is growing. Feeding the trees and growing food with our waste doesn't need to mean dumping composted manure onto the fields, although traditionally it's as simple as that. We are creatures of industry now, but our culture of industry is still in its infancy. 

If this is the case, who is mothering us? We must look to the forces that feel like moss does, mysterious forces that slip out of the wild and the otherworld. Forces we don't even notice anymore because they coat the very surface of our life. It is not so hard to remember them if you try.

In the early days of motherhood, another mother asked me, "how has motherhood been for you?"

"It was rough for a while." I smile. "But it's pretty normal now. He's an easy baby. So happy."

We watch her wily willowy girl playing. She says, "mine was easy too. I like to think we get what we can handle."

_We get what we can handle._ This story comforts me. Other women must be more capable. They get and handle more. I am simply getting what I can handle. Easy, beautiful, perfect. A smiling blue-eyed boy, the one my grandmother always wanted but never got. I know I am so lucky and I feel guilty that it's still so hard for me. Maybe if we only get what we can handle, I can let myself off the hook a bit. 

I don't think it's true, _we get what we can handle._ I think it's probably more true that _we handle what we get._

I let myself be comforted anyways.

A sizeable portion of young people say they don't want kids because of the state of the world. Climate change, culture change, war. I say, hasn't life always been hard? And who better to handle the mess we're in than my kin? 

We handle what we get. So will my children.

A mentor of mine, when I told him I was pregnant, relayed a nugget of wisdom he had received to me: *the greatest thing you will ever do in this life lies within the four walls of your home*. 


I'm allowing it to take root, slowly grow upon me. Someday I might become the fuzzy nest for a creature that emerges to handle what we get - whatever it is.
