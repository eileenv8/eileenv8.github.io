# My Digital Garden

This is a landing page for Eileen's notes, essays, and other tidbits from her personal notebook. 

I love the ethos of a 'digital garden' -- an organically-grown network of one's thoughts and ideas which amasses connections over time through tagging, categorizing, and the like. I hope you enjoy exploring it, and please let me know your thoughts either by emailing me at eileen@jubil.ee or using the (in-progress) commenting feature.
