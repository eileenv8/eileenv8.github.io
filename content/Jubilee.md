# A New Family Name
In 2023, Calvin and I chose a new family name, Jubilee. Neither of us wanted to take the other's last name, and our middle names didn't work. We're still in the process of making the change official in all the important avenues -- passports are done, but not all the credit cards, you know?

Our son, Arthur, was the first official Jubilee. It turns out you can put anything you want as a child's last name, no questions asked!

Marriage is a bit more complicated. We had to petition the court after we were married. 

# So, why Jubilee?
The most basic connotation of jubilee in today's usage is *joy, or a celebration.*

But the word's origins run deep and wide. 

A jubilee is, [according to Claude](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/e0b5f142-2529-4fe9-aefc-95c4f18c55f7)... (who does a better job than I could explaining the origins) : (Emphasis mine -E)

## 1. Basic Etymology and Celebratory Meaning

> At its most fundamental level, "jubilee" comes from the Hebrew word "yōḇēl" (יוֹבֵל), which referred to **a ram's horn trumpet or shofar.** This instrument was **blown to announce special occasions**, particularly the beginning of a sacred year. Over time, the term evolved to **represent celebration itself**—a time of joy, festivity, and commemoration.

> In contemporary usage, jubilee often **simply means a significant anniversary celebration**, particularly a 50th anniversary. This usage has been common since the 14th century when the term entered English via Anglo-French.

## 2. Biblical Foundation: The Year of Release

In the ancient Hebrew tradition as outlined in Leviticus 25, Jubilee was established as a sacred institution occurring every 50 years (after **seven cycles of seven years**). This special year was announced with the blowing of the ram's horn on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).

The biblical Jubilee year had three primary components:

- **Rest for the land (fields would lie fallow)**
- **Release of Israelite indentured servants/slaves**
- **Return of ancestral property to original owners or their heirs**

This system prevented the permanent concentration of land and wealth while providing cyclical opportunities for those who had fallen into economic hardship to start fresh. The Jubilee represented God's ownership of the land—"The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine" (Leviticus 25:23)—and the people's status as stewards rather than absolute owners.
## 3. Theological Meaning: Restoration and Grace

Beyond its economic and social functions, Jubilee held profound theological significance. **It embodied God's mercy and the restoration of right relationships**—between people and God, between people and one another, and between people and the land.

The Jubilee represents a divine intervention in human systems that tend toward inequality and oppression. It demonstrated God's special concern for the poor and marginalized while reminding the wealthy that their prosperity should not come at the expense of others' dignity.

In Christian tradition, Jesus' proclamation in Luke 4:18-19 ("The Spirit of the Lord is upon me... to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor") is often interpreted as announcing a spiritual Jubilee—one that offers forgiveness of sins and liberation from spiritual bondage.
